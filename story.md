# Story

## Setup
- I joined this project.
- third Scrum Master in a project running for a year
- and not for lack of capability of the Scrum Masters we had send
- so it was clear from the beginning that this will not be a chill ride
- to make the setup even more complicated we had
  - two developer from Comsysto in München
  - two developer from Comsysto in Zagreb
  - three developer from Concept in München
  - twoish developer in the US that do their own thing but are totally part of
    the team
  - after working for a year with an unhappy customer and a bullshit code base
    motivation in the team is low
- big corporate customer in München
  - From customer side huge pseudo agile waterfall process
  - feeling the team does not perform 
  - and attempts to create pressure to make the crazy plans work somehow
- So a garbage fire from the beginning

## What to do in such a situation?

- You can try to run
- But sometimes this is not an option
- so ask yourself why you are doing this.
  - if it is for the money: get real, you can most likely make as much money
    with less pain
  - if it is for the people: there might be value in doing this
